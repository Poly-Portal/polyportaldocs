Outbound content (from the server to the client) is retrieved via GET request and inbound content (from the client to the server) is delivered via a POST request * . * There is additional complexity around file uploads. This is explained in the relevant sections. Overview GET Requests GET requests accept url parameters and returns JSON. Example URL parameter: www.abc.com/page?key1=value1&key2=value2 . A valid token must be provided in the HTTP Authorization header. POST Requests (Excluding File Upload) POST accepts JSON bodies as an input and will return JSON. The HTTP Content-type header must be set to application/json . A valid token must be provided in the HTTP Authorization header. POST Request (File Upload Only) POST requests for file uploads must have the HTTP Content-type header set to multipart/form-data A special file upload token must be provided in the HTTP Authorization header. This token is unique to the file being uploaded. Important Terms and Nomenclature. 3D Files : A 3D file is an individual file containing 3d assets. Such files include .FBX and .OBJ files. Artworks : An artwork is a collection of one or more 3D files. One artwork may contain many 3D files. Artworks may also have many versions. HTTP Response Codes and Error Handling Generally, this API does not make use of HTTP response codes. In normal operation, the API will return a HTTP 200 code with a JSON response in the body, regardless of if the request was successful or not. Callers may check if a request was successful using the ok field in the attached JSON. On success the ok field will be set to true . On failure the ok field will be set to false and an error code and message will be included. An example of a successful response: { \"ok\":true ... other JSON data ... } An example of a failed response: { \"ok\":false, \"error\":\"accessDenied\", \"errorMessage\":\"Access to the specified resource is denied.\" } Tokens and The Authorization Header There are two types of tokens. To maintain security the tokens must be kept secret. Tokens are included plaintext in the authorization header using the basic authorization scheme. User tokens. User tokens are issued to users when they log in and are used for most API features. The token uniquely identifies the user. File upload tokens . File upload tokens are issued when uploading a file. When a request is made using a file upload token the token is consumed and another must be generated. See 3DFile/create and 3DFile/upload for more information.
